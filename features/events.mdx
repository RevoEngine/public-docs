# Concept

The Events feature on our platform is ingeniously designed to operate in real time upon certain events.
It provides the flexibility to trigger Jobs where user can design it to work with various business needs.

    style={{ border: "2px solid black", filter: "invert(1)" }}
/>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Firstly">
        Our event listener is listening to all events for your instance.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Secondly">
        When event occur we looking for all configured events for it's type and optionally **filters**.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Lastly">
        We execute bounded [Jobs](/solutions/jobs) to all applicable events.
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Configuration

<Note>You can configure as many events for the same type as you want, you can also use **filters** for predefined events to execute only upon certain action.</Note>

- `Type` - You need to select the **type** (from a list below) or create your own **Custom Event** which can be invoked directly in your [Component](/components).
- `Job` - Select [Job](/solutions/jobs) that will be executed upon trigger.

# Types

<Tip>The Events feature on our platform is designed to respond in real-time to various predefined or custom events. This dynamic functionality enables users to trigger Jobs tailored to specific occurrences within the platform, enhancing operational responsiveness and efficiency. This list is **constantly evolving**.</Tip>
