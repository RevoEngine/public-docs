# 2. Incident Priorities

**P4 (Low)** Instance is not affected, this type of priority is used for:
- Feedback.
- Feature requests.
- General questions.
- Incidents related to Preview functionality.

**P3 (Normal)** Instance has one or more of the following:
- Unexpected behavior of Platform functionality, which has a very randomized effect, that is hard to predict and difficult to replicate.
- Performance degradation of the Platform (e.g., API response times), requests are successfully processed but with the delay which might cause low to medium business impact.
- Partial and non-critical loss of functionality of the Platform where users are able to login and use most of the core functionalities, that has low to medium business impact, temporary workaround is available.
- Loss of functionality of the Platform with high business impact but temporary workaround is applied (a temporary solution was applied and Ticket was downgraded from **P2 - High**).

**P2 (High)** Instance has one or more of the following:
- Performance degradation of the Platform (e.g., API response times), requests are successfully processed but with the delay which might cause high business impact.
- Partial and non-critical loss of functionality of the Platform where users are able to login and use most of the core functionalities, that it has high business impact, temporary workaround is available.
- Loss of functionality of the Platform with high business impact but temporary workaround is applied (a temporary solution was applied and Ticket was downgraded from **P1 - Critical**).

**P1 (Critical)** Instance has one or more of the following:
- Platform is down and irresponsive, which causes high business impact.
- Critical loss of functionality of the Platform and no temporary workaround is available.
- Security vulnerability has been identified.

<Note>RevoNG Support has ability to downgrade the priority if it does not follow provided guidelines.</Note>

# 3. Optional Upgrade

- As a part of the Agreement, the Customer is provided with the ability to upgrade their support level. Currently, Start Customers are not able to get any commitments when it comes to initial response time.
- Standard, Plus, Business and Enterprise Customers are supported with Standard level of the support free of charge where Plus, Business and Enterprise Customers are able to upgrade their support level.

There is no possibility of accessing optional upgrade of the support services where contracted instance has higher tier, e.g. Standard cannot be upgraded with no exceptions, additional examples:
- Customers with Plus tier are not able to upgrade their level of the support services to Business and Enterprise which is lower overall than their contracted instance Agreement.
- Business Customers can use both Plus and Business upgrades.
- Enterprise Customers can use full range of the optional upgrades starting from Plus.
