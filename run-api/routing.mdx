# General
Unlike most of the controller matching, RevoEngine handles controllers more dynamically.
The structure is flat, and we use the following pattern to match dynamic values against correct **Endpoint**.
Paths for **Endpoints** without dynamic property of `@` are straight forward, while the dynamic works like this:

<Tip>We also support partial dynamic attributes, so you are not forced to divide it by `/` e.g.: `/v1/us@` is valid path. If you are not sure how your endpoints will be treated, you can use built-in routing matcher in `Endpoint` view, by clicking at `Check route`.</Tip>

## Example
For this example we use endpoint of: `/v1/users/@` where `@` corresponds to dynamic parameter.
Assuming we have two endpoints:
- Endpoint 1 - `/v1/users/@` -> bound to `Users Component`.
- Endpoint 2 - `/v1/users/00000000-@` -> bound to `Admin Component`.
- Endpoint 3 - `/v1/users/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` -> bound to [mocked response](/run-api/configuration#response).
- Endpoint 4 - `/v1/users/00000000-@/update` -> bound to `Update Component`.

### Example 1
When a client sends request to `/v1/users/00000100-0000-0000-0000-123456789012` they will get `Endpoint 1` as this is the most accurate hit.

### Example 2
When a client sends request to `/v1/users/00000000-0000-0000-0000-123456789012` they will get `Endpoint 2` as this is the most accurate hit.

### Example 3
When a client sends request to `/v1/users/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` they will get `Endpoint 3` as this is the most accurate hit.

### Example 4
When a client sends request to `/v1/users/00000000-123/update` they will get `Endpoint 4` as this is the most accurate hit.

### Example 5
When a client sends request to `/v1/users/00000001-123/update` they will get `404` error code, as such an Endpoint doesn't exist.
