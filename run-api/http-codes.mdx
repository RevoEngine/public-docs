# Default Responses

| Code  | Description                                                                                          |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `200` | `OK` - Default response except POST method.                                                          |
| `201` | `Created` - Default response of POST method.                                                         |
| `401` | `Unauthorized` - Authentication is required.                                                         |
| `429` | `Too Many Requests` - Your request has been throttled (check your Run API quota).                    |
| `502` | `Bad Gateway` - Error during executing Endpoint (most likely misconfiguration or compilation error). |

<Note>In case of `429`, we recommend to retry the request using exponential backoff.</Note>

# Custom Success
In case of success response, we allow users to configure their success HTTP code in range of 200-299 ([successful responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status#successful_responses)).
