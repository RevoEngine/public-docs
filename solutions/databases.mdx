Databases are designed to give developers effortless data management regardless of scale, instead we rely on a data type.
You can configure a schema and share if for different databases regardless of their purpose.

You can access and manage its data via intuitive interface, API or during [Component](/features/components) execution.

<Steps>
    <Step title="Schema">
        Configure a [schema](/features/schema) for a database, or use existing one, where you can specify name of fields and their types, requirements, relations and more.
        <Note>You can also use our [AI assistant](/features/ai-assistant) to convert your existing SQL or NoSQL schema into our [Schema](/features/schema).</Note>
    </Step>
    <Step title="Type">
        Select a proper type for it's purpose, whether you need a relations, write performance, high read throughput and more.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Manage">
        Create, update and delete data via interface, API or via [Component](/features/components) execution.
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Types

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Table`     | Designed for typical use cases where you want to have relations and response time is mandatory (e.g. CRUD operations, think about it as a RDBMS database) with transactions. |
| `Warehouse` | Designed for big data (data warehouse) workloads with a latency and throughput trade-off (analytics, transactional data, logs, invoicing, and more) without transactions.    |
| `Data`      | Designed for low latency and high-throughput workloads (time-series, financial data, gaming, ML, IoT and more) with ACID transactions.                                       |

Besides that you can access your schemaless `Memory` database designed for zero latency queries and caching.

<Tip>You can optionally configure security rules, to restrict only certain users and/or groups to access the database and its
    content on the database level; unlike the field restriction, this is on database level.</Tip>
