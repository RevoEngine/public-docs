title: 'Realtime'
description: 'Build your own WebSocket service effortlessly.'
---

Realtime on our platform is a WebSocket as a service where you can design and configure your realtime solutions.
WebSockets enables clients with bidirectional communication between a client and a server and receives updates in real time.
As of now, we support only single directional communication, however, you can send messages through API or [Components](features/components).

<Note>You must send PING requests as keep-alive policy, so you will not be disconnected from the server, you must send a message with 'PING' request at least once a minute</Note>

## Authentication

To authenticate against our live service, you must have given a role of `REALTIME_CONNECT` so you
can send custom messages to your clients from Components (subject to change in the future).

You also must connect against `wss` (WebSocket Secure), `ws` by design is not allowed.

```js
const token = 'Bearer ...';
const instance = '';
const wsUrl = `wss://live.revong.com/?authorization=${token}&instance=${instance}`;

const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
```

<Note>We support presence of authorization and instance tokens in query parameter as well as in headers, similar to our API.
Due to the limitation of many clients you must pass it in query parameters as in given example, from security standpoint it doesn't matter,
connection goes trough TLS only, and we don't permit other way around, we also **don't store these tokens in our logging systems**.</Note>


## Sending a message

You can send messages directly from the `Sandbox API`, it is limited to 4kB per message as of now.
```typescript
async sendRealtimeMessage(channel: string, message: unknown);
await sendRealtimeMessage('ALL', { hello: 'world!'});
```

### Channels

Channels are bound to the instance that you are connected to, where you can configure your own channels and/or use defined channels.
You can send messages to:
- `ALL` to broadcast a message to all logged clients.
- `groupId` to broadcast a message to specific a group.
- `userId` to broadcast a message to specific user only.
- Configured channels by you with restrictions on user or group level (or any other advanced filters).

### Limits

Payload is limited up to 1kB (1024 bytes), but you can request quota increase.

# Example

Here is a full code sample including PING & PONG keep-alive, message receiver using WebSocket API.

```html

            }
                #messages {
                margin-top: 20px;
                border: 1px solid #ccc;
                padding: 10px;
                max-width: 600px;
                height: 500px;
                overflow-y: scroll;
            }
                .message {
                border-bottom: 1px solid #eee;
                padding: 5px 0;
            }
            </style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>WebSocket Message Display</h1>
<div id="messages"></div>

<script>
    const token = 'Bearer ...';
    const instance = '';
    const wsUrl = `wss://live.dev.revong.com/?authorization=${token}&instance=${instance}`;

    const ws = new WebSocket(wsUrl);
    const messagesDiv = document.getElementById('messages');

    const append = (data) => {
    const message = document.createElement('div');
    message.className = 'message';
    message.textContent = data;
    messagesDiv.appendChild(message);
    messagesDiv.scrollTop = messagesDiv.scrollHeight;
}

    ws.onopen = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket is open now.');
    setInterval(() => {
    const message = JSON.stringify({ type: 'PING'});
    ws.send(message);
    append("PUSH ->" + message)
}, 30000);
};

    ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    append("PULL ->" + event.data);
};

    ws.onerror = function(event) {
    console.error('WebSocket error observed:', event);
};

    ws.onclose = function(event) {
    console.log('WebSocket is closed now.');
};
</script>
</body>
</html>
```
