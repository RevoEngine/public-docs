# Concept

Jobs on our platform are a critical feature for orchestrating asynchronous tasks, designed to trigger in real-time
based on various operational events.

They are the cornerstone of automation, capable of responding to a wide range of
triggers such as [Events](/features/events), [Schedule](/features/schedule), direct [Component](/features/components)
executions, as well as manual (via a platform) and more, offering a comprehensive solution for diverse business automation needs.

Similar to [Endpoints](/solutions/endpoints) it executes configured [Component](/features/components).

/>

    style={{ border: "2px solid black", filter: "invert(1)" }}
/>

<Steps>
    <Step title="Trigger">
        Received a trigger to execute a **Job**: Manual Trigger (via platform or [API request](/api-reference/automation/run-template)), [Event](/features/events), [Schedule](/features/schedule), [Component](/features/components)
    </Step>
    <Step title="Details">
        Based on given configuration, we are preparing the Job and keep updating it's status upon progress (check statuses).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Updates">
        We constantly monitor and update status of the Job and send [Notifications](/features/notifications).
    </Step>
    <Step title="Finish">
        We track all the details including logs, warnings, errors, results of the Job so you can find it all in a single place.
    </Step>
</Steps>

# Features

## Triggers

- `Events` - set up your event to trigger a job using **real-time** [Events](/features/events).
- `Schedule` - set up your schedule to trigger a job using **cron-like** [Schedule](/features/schedule).
- `API Trigger` - trigger a job via an [API request](/api-reference/automation/run-template).
- `Component` - trigger a job via code with [Component](/features/components) including extra payload or <Tooltip tip="Trigger your Job that will be scheduled, up to 30 days in advance.">scheduled delivery</Tooltip>.

    alt="Jobs 1"
    title="Jobs 1"
    style={{ border: "2px solid black", width: "500px" }}
/>

- `Manual Trigger` - trigger Job execution via a platform.

<img
    src="/images/jobs-1.png"
    alt="Jobs 1"
    title="Jobs 1"
    style={{ border: "2px solid black", width: "500px" }}
/>

## Retry Mechanism

Sometimes your job can fail due to defined (or not) error handling, e.g. you have a task to fetch currencies from API endpoint and save it to the [Database](/solutions/databases), but your currency API endpoint is not reachable.
You can `Retry` this job **manually** in a platform or configure **automated** retry-mechanism.

<img

    alt="Jobs 3"
    title="Jobs 3"
    style={{ border: "2px solid black", width: "500px" }}
/>

## Asynchronous Execution

Jobs are configured to perform tasks asynchronously, they are distributed and ensuring efficient and timely operations.
Your [Components](/features/components) are executed and running in background.

## Scheduled Delivery

Configure your [Component](/features/components) trigger to execute a job up to 30 days in advance.

## Notifications

Users can subscribe to receive real-time updates on Job status changes, staying informed about their operational progress.

<img
    src="/images/jobs-4.png"
    alt="Jobs 4"
    title="Jobs 4"
    style={{ border: "2px solid black", width: "500px" }}
/>

# Configuration

Besides the [common properties](/features/search) like `name`, `category`, `description`, you can configure these properties.

| Property            | Required | Description                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Component`         | Yes      | You can select [Component](/components) that will be executed upon request.                                                         |
| `Component Version` | No       | You can select specific version of [Component](/components), default: `LATEST`.                                                     |
| `Trigger Account`   | No       | Select account that will be bound to execution context of a job (e.g. accessible with api.currentUser() method), default: `System`. |

# Input

Similar to [Endpoints Inputs](/run-api/configuration#input) you can configure some predefined flags.

| Property            | Required | Description                                                                                                                         |
|---------------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Skip Libs`         | No       | Whether the compiler should ignore [Component Libraries](/components/library) during compilation.                                   |

### `excludeLibs`
You can configure the names of specific [Component Libraries](/components/library) that should **not be compiled** into execution.
This might be useful if you have libraries that are still work in progress or used sometimes, by default RevoEngine compiles all libraries into execution context.
<Note>If you have some libraries that are `Active` but they cannot compile (e.g. syntax error) you will get `Errors` of compiler (it should not affect execution if this library is not used, but warnings will come to your logs). Ideally they should be excluded with this option.</Note>

### `includeLibs`
You can configure the names of specific [Component Libraries](/components/library) that should **be compiled** into execution.
This might be useful if you have hundreds of libraries that won't be used in this execution context to improve the performance of Job execution.
