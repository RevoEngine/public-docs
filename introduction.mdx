RevoEngine is a **low-code** AI-powered platform that democratizes software development.
Designed for individuals and businesses regardless of their size (from startup to enterprise),
it offers an intuitive interface and API for creating and managing applications.

All our solutions are fully managed, take advantage of full **serverless experience** without being worried about
infrastructure, monitoring, security, scaling and billing.
Our platform integrates best practices for performance and scalability, providing a unified solution without the
complexity of traditional software development.

Key solutions include:
- Dynamic [Database](/solutions/databases) management available from interface, an API or via Component execution.
- Fully customizable API [Endpoints](/solutions/endpoints) that you can configure for your needs.
- [File](/solutions/files) storage, with intuitive explorer, ease of file categorization, and other integrations.
- Configure asynchronous **tasks** with [Jobs](/solutions/jobs) that can be executed via [Events](/features/events),
periodic cron-like [Schedule](/features/schedule), or directly with any other [Component](/solutions/component).
- [Realtime](/solutions/realtime) service based on **WebSocket** giving you flexibility of building real-time applications.
- [Webhooks](/solutions/webhooks) that will distribute your requests to downstream systems upon any activity.
- Built-in developer tools where all you need to innovate is a browser, even to play with the code you can do it
using [WebIDE](/features/web-ide) which is constantly improving.
